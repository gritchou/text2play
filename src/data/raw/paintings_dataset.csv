57727444edc2cb3880cb7bf6,Mona Lisa,da Vinci Leonardo,1519.0,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/00475/images/leonardo-da-vinci/0000136308-og.JPG!Large.JPG,408,600,portrait,High Renaissance,57726d85edc2cb3880b48ccd,"One of the most iconic and recognizable paintings in the world is the [i]Mona Lisa[/i] (ca. 1503-1519) painted by Leonardo da Vinci. The unique appeal of the portrait lies in its enigmatic nature, Mona Lisa’s smile radiates mystery, sensuality and contentment. This was achieved through sfumato, Leonardo’s painting technique that softened the transition between colors. This depth and complexity of expression is the reason the [i]Mona Lisa[/i] is regarded as the pinnacle of portraiture. The interest in the portrait was further amplified by its mysterious history: the identity of the sitter, who commissioned the painting, how long Leonardo worked on the portrait and how it entered the French royal collection are all topics of scholarly debate. 

It is thought that the sitter was Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo. For this reason, the painting is sometimes called [i]La Gioconda[/i]. The earliest identification of the painting was provided by the Renaissance art historian [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-vasari]Giorgio Vasari[/url]. In Vasari’s 1550 biography of Leonardo, he wrote about the magnificent portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, which Leonardo worked on between 1503 and 1506. Many were skeptical of Vasari’s account; however, a 2005 discovery at the University of Heidelberg provided compelling new evidence that confirms Vasari’s assertion. In a volume written by the ancient philosopher Cicero from 1477, there was a handwritten marginal by Leonardo’s contemporary, the secretary and assistant to Niccolò Machiavelli, Agostino Vespucci. In the note dated October 1503, Vespucci praises Leonardo’s skill by comparing him to the Greek and painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/apelles]Apelles[/url], and states that Leonardo is working on a portrait of Lisa del Giacondo.

The [i]Mona Lisa[/i] was the earliest example in Italian portraiture that portrayed the sitter in a half-length format. Leonardo presented a new artistic formula: the figure is shown at half-length sitting in armchair in front of a [i]loggia[/i] - a gallery or room with one or more open sides. The incorporation of the [i]loggia[/i] allowed Leonardo to present an imaginary landscape as the backdrop of the portrait. This significant innovation influenced Leonardo contemporaries: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael]Raphael[/url] adopted the composition and pose in his portrait [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/portrait-of-a-lady-with-a-unicorn-1506][i]Young Woman with Unicorn[/i][/url] (ca. 1506). Still it is important to note that Leonardo was indebted to Flemish portraiture of the second half of the 15th century, particularly the portraits of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling]Hans Memling[/url] such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling/barbara-de-vlaenderberch-1475][i]Portrait of Barbara van Vlaendenbergh[/i][/url] (ca. 1470-1472) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling/portrait-of-a-man-holding-a-coin-of-the-emperor-nero-1474][i]Man with a Roman coin[/i][/url] (ca. 1480).

Leonardo spent his final years in France, where his patron the King of France, Francis I, purchased [i]Mona Lisa[/i] for the royal French collection. From 1797, the portrait is on permanent display at the Louvre and is the crown jewel of the museum collection. On the morning of August 22 1911, Louvre employees were shocked to discover that the painting was stolen the previous night. Two years later, Louvre employee Vincenzo Peruggia was identified as the thief. Peruggia claimed his motives were patriotic: he believed Leonardo’s masterpiece belonged in Italy and was caught trying to sell the painting in Florence. After its discovery, the [i]Mona Lisa[/i] was exhibited throughout Italy before its celebratory return to the Louvre in 1914.",FlorenceItaly

Below the exploding stars, the village is a place of quiet order. Connecting earth and sky is the flamelike cypress, a tree traditionally associated with graveyards and mourning. But death was not ominous for van Gogh. ""Looking at the stars always makes me dream,"" he said, ""Why, I ask myself, shouldn't the shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France? Just as we take the train to get to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to reach a star.""
The artist wrote of his experience to his brother Theo: ""This morning I saw the country from my window a long time before sunrise, with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big."" This morning star, or Venus, may be the large white star just left of center in The Starry Night. The hamlet, on the other hand, is invented, and the church spire evokes van Gogh's native land, the Netherlands. The painting, like its daytime companion, The Olive Trees, is rooted in imagination and memory. Leaving behind the Impressionist doctrine of truth to nature in favor of restless feeling and intense color, as in this highly charged picture, van Gogh made his work a touchstone for all subsequent Expressionist painting.",Saint-rémy-de-provenceFrance

57726e7bedc2cb3880b7466a,The Birth of Venus,Botticelli Sandro ,1485.0,https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/sandro-botticelli/the-birth-of-venus-1485(1).jpg!Large.jpg,750,500,mythological painting,Early Renaissance,57726d7dedc2cb3880b47c88,"[i]The Birth of Venus[/i], painted by Sandro Botticelli in the 1480s, is one of the most famous paintings in the world: it is a celebrated work of art and the high point of a visit to the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. It is also a commercial icon and a line mark of European Art.

The real subject of the painting and its meaning is a mystery under discussion. Over the centuries, many theories and interpretations have been developed, proving the complexity of this work of art. The composition of the painting is quite simple: in the center, there’s a figure of Venus, goddess of love, standing in a shell being washed up on a beach, blown there by two personifications of winds visible on the left, and welcomed by a maiden on the right. There is a contrast between the title of the work and what it represents: we do not see the moment of Venus’ birth. According to the myth, she was born from the foam of the sea, but the painting shows us the moment when she arrives on land. It is clear that the personifications of the winds are Zephyrus and Aura, one impetuous and the other moderate. But the figure of the girl is uncertain: she could be Spring, a subject dear to Botticelli, because her dress is full of flowers, or the personification of motherhood, or one of the Three Graces. She has branches of roses around her waist, and myrtle branches around her neck - sacred plants for Venus.

The painting is a masterpiece of linearity and harmonious design, clarity, and brightness of colors, which includes the use of gold in a lot of detail. We have to remember that the painting today is not as glorious it was initially. The colors were brighter, especially the greens of the trees, and the blue of the sky.

[i]The Birth of Venus[/i] is a work of extraordinary innovation, from many points of view. First, it is a representation of a nude woman: this kind of subject was restricted during the Medieval ages - the only exception was an image of Eve in the Garden of Eden. Botticielli produced the image of a beautiful naked woman, with a gaze that is remarkably in direct engagement with the viewer. Next, there is the news of the mythological theme that in the 1480s was absolutely a new type of painting. Botticelli obviously read classical texts before painting it: for example, the Roman writer Plinio made the description of the painting by the Greek artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/apelles]Apelles[/url] that showed Venus rising from the sea or a Homeric hymn that told about Zephyrus that blows his wind on Aphrodite. 

But not only the classical world was the source of Botticelli's work. He depicted the scene with a solemnity that recalls a religious rite; the disposition of the characters and their gestures remind representations of the Baptism of Christ, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-verrocchio/the-baptism-of-christ]that of Verrocchio[/url], which Botticelli had certainly seen. This iconographic analogy alludes, perhaps, to a thematic analogy between the mythical birth of the goddess from the sea and the Christian birth of the soul from the water of Baptism.

It is highly probable that the work was commissioned by a member of the Medici family (perhaps by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, a major patron of Botticelli, under the influence of his cousin Lorenzo de' Medici, ""il Magnifico""), although there is nothing written about the painting before 1550, when [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-vasari]Giorgio Vasari[/url] describes it in the Medici’s Villa of Castello, owned by the cadet branch of the Medici family since the mid-15th century. This hypothesis would seem to be born out by the orange trees in the painting, which are considered an emblem of the Medici dynasty, on account of the assonance between the family name and the name of the orange tree, which at the time was ‘[i]mala medica[/i]’.",

The Stanza was the first set of rooms to be decorated, and this painting was the second in the set of paintings that adorn the walls. Although it was created for a grand room in the Vatican, nearly every one of the figures in the painting can be identified as a Greek philosopher, rather than a religious character. Raphael included the likeness of Michelangelo himself in the painting, as the philosopher Heraclitus. ",

Today, Claude Monet is primarily known as a landscape painter, but in the beginning of his artistic career, he used to concentrate on portraits. No one else appeares in Monet's paintings as often as Camille. In those year, portraits of women were mostly ordered by bourgeois clients, but among progressive painters, the artistic structure became more important than the identity of the portrayed person. The masterly style, the lack of details, and the plainness of the colours led to a completely new directness of expression, independent of the facial gestures of the depicted person. In this picture, the shimmering reds, blues, greens, and white that capture the brilliance of a sun-drenched day are applied with many small brushstrokes, whose varied shapes create the different textures of flowers, grass, and clothing. Meanwhile, the features of the woman are completely indistinct.",

This painting is one in which Klimt deviated from his portrayal of dominant in women in the form of a femme fatale. Instead is the portrayal of love and art, a couple locked in a golden-flecked, flower-filled embrace. Klimt was a man with an unbridled sexual appetite, as he fathered at least 14 illegitimate children. It is rumored that Klimt and his longtime companion, Emile Floge, who was also said to be his lover, were the models of the painting, which was selected to be printed on the Austrian 100 euro coin, minted in 2003.

The right side of the table is not in the same plane as the left side of the table, which was a stylized method used by Cezanne to incorporate the differences of viewpoint into an impressionistic still life. It was this technique that made it possible to bridge the gap between impressionists and cubism, which employed varying perspective and varying angles to depict subjects. As such, this still life is an example of the way in which Cezanne tried to deal with the complexities of visual perception. ",

The men, on the other hand, are his brother, Eugene Manet, and his brother in law, Ferdinand Leenhoff.

The majestic beauty of the woman is emphasised by her regal bearing and elaborate jewellery.

The striking design of the 'Zodiac' calendar quickly attracted the attention of Léon Deschamps, chief editor of 'La Plume'; he bought the rights to distribute it as the magazine's calendar for 1897.

Whereas some believe that the middle panel, which depicts a fantastical world of nudes in sexual engagement, large fruits, and other suggestive elements, is simply an illustration of paradise lost, others believe that it is a moral warning, which will lead you to hell, as it is depicted in the third panel of the series.

Adele Bloch-Bauer was the only person to be painted twice by Klimt. This painting is perhaps most famous not for its artistic quality, but because of its scandalous history since inception.

In 1945, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer designated the paintings to be the property of his nephew and nieces, including Maria Altmann. Nonetheless, the Austrian government retained ownership of the painting, and was not returned to the Altmann family until 2006 after a long court battle.

The subtle shading evokes a host of textures exuding softness, warmth, and the absence of immediate tension. The robe has slipped off the sitter's shoulder, exposing her right breast. Coupled with the absent stare of the woman and the dog, the muted colors and faint contours give this composition an overall flatness.

The sitter is Kitty Garman, Freud's first wife, and a noted beauty whose father was artist Jacob Epstein. The dog was one of two bull terriers they were given as a wedding gift.

Freud painted many portraits of Kitty during their brief marriage, which ended in divorce in 1952, due to his chronic infidelities. A weariness in the sitter's expression, the deep hollows under her eyes and the self-supporting gesture of the hand under the left breast hint at her discontent, despite this moment of calm. The analytic distance that came to characterize Freud's brilliance as an observer is reinforced by the absence of a name in the title, despite his intimate connection to the subjects.

As a method of self-promotion and advertisement, Courbet made an impression with his self-portraits, and used them to find his own artistic style. After this period, Courbet became convinced that painters should illustrate the world around them as they see it and his realistic work in the later 1840’s gained support among younger realist and neo-romantic painters.

With its expressive colours, its flowing lines and striking overall effect, its appeal is universal.

Despite radical simplification, the landscape in the picture is recognisable as the Kristiania Fjord seen from Ekeberg, with a broad view over the fjord, the town and the hills beyond. In the background to the left, at the end of the path with the balustrade that cuts diagonally across the picture, we see two strolling figures, often regarded as two friends whom Munch mentions in notes relating to the picture. But the figure in the foreground is the first to capture the viewer’s attention. Its hands are held to its head and its mouth is wide open in a silent scream, which is amplified by the undulating movement running through the surrounding landscape. The figure is ambiguous and it is hard to say whether it is a man or a woman, young or old – or even if it is human at all.

As with many of Munch’s pictures, it is assumed that here as well his starting point was private feelings and experience. His diaries contain several remarks that seem to form a background to this depiction of existential angst, among them the following: “I was walking along the road with two friends – Then the sun went down – The sky suddenly turned to blood and I felt a great scream in nature –”.

The Scream was first exhibited at Munch’s solo exhibition in Berlin in 1893. It was a central element in “The Frieze of Life”, and has been the theme of probing analysis and many suggested interpretations. The painting also exists in a later version, which is in the possession of the Munch Museum. In addition Munch worked with the motif in drawings, pastels and prints.

His early submissions to the Salon reveal this fierce desire to succeed. After his ambitious Equality before Death (1849), the young man aimed to create an impression once again. He put forward an even larger painting inspired by Dante whose work was much loved by the Romantics and who captured all its dramatic beauty. This painting was inspired by a short scene from the Inferno, set in the eighth circle of Hell (the circle for falsifiers and counterfeiters), where Dante, accompanied by Virgil, watches a fight between two damned souls: Capocchio, a heretic and alchemist is attacked and bitten on the neck by Gianni Schicchi who had usurped the identity of a dead man in order to fraudulently claim his inheritance.

The critic and poet Théophile Gautier was very complimentary: ""Gianni Schicchi throws himself at Capocchio, his rival, with a strange fury, and Monsieur Bouguereau depicts magnificently through muscles, nerves, tendons and teeth, the struggle between the two combatants. There is bitterness and strength in this canvas – strength, a rare quality!” In fact, Bouguereau here shows great boldness. He is exploring the aesthetic boundaries: exaggerating the muscle structure to the point of distorting it, exaggerating the poses, contrasting colour and shadows, depicting monstrous figures and groups of damned souls. We are particularly reminded of the sublime visions of Romantic artists like Blake (1757-1827), Füssli (1741-1825), and Lawrence (1769-1830). Everything in this painting underlines the feeling of terribilita and horror: a theme to which Bouguereau would never again return.",

Sarah Bernhardt was both director and actor. This poster by Mucha was produced to promote the new production which opened on 4 January, 1895.

Mucha portrayed Bernardt as an exotic Byzantine noblewoman wearing a splendid gown and an orchid headdress with a palm branch in her hand. This costume was worn in the last act, the climax of the play, where she joined the Easter procession. Placing her life-size figure on an arched platform, Mucha rendered the beauty and dignity of her personality onstage rather than representing her realistic features or the story.

Those sent to hell for the sin of greed are boiled in pots of gold, and in the sin of pride a demon holds a mirror up to a prideful woman.

The comparison to Leonardo Da Vinci’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/mona-lisa][i]Mona Lisa[/i][/url] (ca. 1504) makes sense: both paintings share an air of mystery, from the model’s enigmatic gaze to the speculations surrounding the identities of the women in the paintings. The identity of the model in [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i] remains unknown. Some have suggested that it is Vermeer’s eldest daughter, Maria, however there is no compelling evidence to confirm this assertion.

The painting is considered a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/tronie#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]tronie[/url], a subcategory of portraiture that was popular in the Dutch Golden Age and Flemish [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Baroque[/url] art. Tronies are studies of facial characteristics, stereotypical characters or exaggerated expressions. Vermeer captures a fleeting moment, the girl turning her head, her lips slightly parted while she directly faces the viewer. The girl wears a head wrap inspired by a Turkish turban and an enormous pearl earring. These exotic elements increase the drama of the painting, and give the artist the opportunity to display artistic effects in his treatment of light and texture. Another tronie by Vermeer, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/study-of-a-young-woman][i]Study of A Young Woman[/i][/url] (ca. 1665-1667) is often seen as a variant or counterpart of [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i]. In both paintings, the figures are set against a black background, wearing the pearl earring and having a scarf draped over the shoulder. While [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i] is an idealized beauty, the [i]Study of A Young Woman[/i] shows plain and imperfect facial features.

Even though [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i] is consistent with Vermeer’s style and technique, it is distinct in a few noteworthy ways. Vermeer used his inventive method of layering paint that created the sensuality of the soft skin. This was accomplished by layering a thin flesh-colored glaze over a transparent under-modelling (the initial layers of color placed on the surface). Some have suggested that Vermeer was able to capture these details and effects through the use of [i]camera obscura[/i], an optical device that was able to project an image onto a flat surface. Vermeer employed this technique in other paintings, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/woman-holding-a-balance-1665][i]Woman Holding a Balance[/i][/url] (1665) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/young-woman-with-a-water-pitcher][i]Young Woman with a Water Pitcher[/i][/url] (ca. 1662-1665). In both cases, Vermeer used this technique of layering paint when creating the shaded portions of the headdress on the models.  However, in [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i], the application of paint is bolder and more expressive. In a 1994 restoration, it was discovered that Vermeer accentuated girl’s mouth with small dots of pink paint, and placed light accents in her eyes to brighten her face. The model is set against a dark background, which is very different than the detailed settings of Vermeer’s interior paintings, such as the mentioned [i]Woman Holding a Balance[/i] and [i]Young Woman with a Water Pitcher[/i]. In the interior settings, the women are portrayed in contemplative and quiet moments, while [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i] has a sense of immediacy and drama. The painting has a timeless quality, the girl bears no symbolic attributes, and she is not placed in any specific context. For this reason, she has captured the imagination of viewers throughout generations.",

One of the best-known images of 20th-century art, the painting depicts an all-night diner in which three customers, all lost in their own thoughts, have congregated. Fluorescent lights had just come into use in the early 1940s, and the all-night diner emits an eerie glow, like a beacon on the dark street corner. Hopper eliminated any reference to an entrance, and the viewer, drawn to the light, is shut out from the scene by a seamless wedge of glass. The four anonymous and uncommunicative night owls seem as separate and remote from the viewer as they are from one another. Reworked and parodied countless times, Nighthawks has become an icon of American culture.",

The wall painting was commissioned by the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, who was Leonardo’s patron during his first extended stay in Milan.

The composition of [i]The Last Supper[/i] is neatly arranged - Jesus is positioned in the center of a long table and the Apostles are to his left and right. The room is relatively plain: dark tapestries cover the walls on either side, while three windows on the back wall reveal a landscape that recalls the countryside of Milan. Leonardo created the illusion of space by using linear perspective – a technique in which all parallel lines in the painting converge in a single vanishing point. In [i]The Last Supper[/i], the single vanishing point, at Jesus’s right temple, draws the viewer’s attention to the main subject in the foreground. Jesus adorns the traditional blue and red robes, but he has no halo. Some scholars have suggested that Leonardo alludes to the halo through the shining light from the window behind Jesus, or the pediment above the window. Others however believed that the absence of the halo signifies the fact that Jesus is a still human being, who, as such, will suffer through the pain and death of the Passion.

In his depiction of [i]The Last Supper[/i], Leonardo chose to present the scene as a depiction of successive moments: Jesus has declared to the Apostles that one of them will betray him, and the Apostles react to his announcement. The serene expression and posture of Christ stands in contrast to the confused and agitated state of the Apostles. Their reactions and postures vary, adding interest and drama to the composition: on Christ’s left, James the Greater throws his arms out in anger, Thomas gestures to the sky as if to question God’s plan, and Phillip points towards himself wondering could he be the traitor. Some reactions hold additional symbolism: Peter holds a knife behind his back that he will later use to cut off an ear of a soldier attempting to arrest Christ. Judas, who is next to Peter, tightly grips the purse with the reward he received for betraying Jesus with one hand, while he reaches toward a dish with the other. Judas and Jesus reach for the same dish, a reference to the biblical quote: “[i]The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me[/i]” (Matthew 26:23).

When painting [i]The Last Supper[/i] Leonardo used an experimental technique, working with tempera and oil paint. The experimental technique combined with the humidity and the dampness of the location led to the quick deterioration of the painting. Over the centuries, the painting suffered additional damage. Due to its poor condition, the painting underwent a major restoration that began in 1978. The restoration, completed in 1999, proved controversial: many were dissatisfied with the outcome saying that hardly any of Leonardo’s original work is visible. Still, some praised the recovery of many details, like the food on the table and the facial expressions.",MilanItaly

Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was thus not depicting an ordinary evening at the Moulin Rouge, the fashionable Parisian nightclub but rather a specific moment when a man now known only by his nickname (which certainly describes his nimbleness as a dancer) appears to be teaching the ""can-can."" Many of the inhabitants of the scene are well-known members of Lautrec's demimonde of prostitutes and artists and people seen only at night including the white-bearded Irish poet William Butler Yeats who leans on the bar. One of the mysteries, however, is the dominant woman in the foreground, the beauty of her profile made all the more so in comparison with that of her chinless companion. It is the latter who expresses better than nearly any other character in this full stage of people Lautrec's profoundly touching ability to be brutally truthful but also truly kind in his observations",ParisFrance

His depiction of the farcical Quixote and the short and paunchy Sancho Panza became so famous that they influenced entire generations of readers. The images he created depicting Quixote, Panza, and the other characters through their episodes became so popular that they became the standard for the way in which people viewed the characters in the book. Further stage and film publications, as well as public image, were all based on Dore’s depiction of Quixote’s physical appearance.  ",
